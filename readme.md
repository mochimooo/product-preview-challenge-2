# Frontend Mentor - Product preview card component solution

This is a solution to the [Product preview card component challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/product-preview-card-component-GO7UmttRfa). This is the second time I am tackling this challenge with the help of Kevin Powell's video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2WL6KkqhLQ&ab_channel=KevinPowell). Inspired by バレンタイン 😈 (@vcarames)'s challenge, I took liberty of changing the picture, product description, and background color to make it a little more fun while learning how to code correctly this time.
