# Frontend Mentor - Product preview card component solution

This is a solution to the [Product preview card component challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/product-preview-card-component-GO7UmttRfa). It's the second time I am tackling this challenge with the help of Kevin Powell's video on YouTube (link in Acknowledgments section). Inspired by „Éê„É¨„É≥„Çø„Ç§„É≥ üòà (@vcarames)'s challenge, I took liberty of changing the picture, product description, and background color to make it a little more fun while learning how to code correctly this time.

Also shout out to @vcarames on Frontend Mentor that gives me the idea to redo this challenge with a different design.
